Just playing to see if the Learning Lab only installs on this repo

.... And, now I know it creates a new repo and you have to install it on that new repo
for every class you take. So this repo is a complete waste of time. I could have just installed
it on any repo, let it create the new repo, installed it on that repo and then removed it from 
the first repo. Any questions?
